                    Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data.
                    It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence.
                    Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data,
                    in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.
                    Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine,
                    email filtering, speech recognition, and computer vision, where it is difficult
                    or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.

                A subset of machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers;
                but not all machine learning is statistical learning. For more, kindly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">visit</a>.
